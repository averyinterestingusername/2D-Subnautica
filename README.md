# 2D-Subnautica

Hello! I like Subnautica, and I've wanted to program a game for a while now.

### I really wanted the demo to be a playable game, and I spent many hours trying to get it to work, but I couldn't. If you want to play the game yourself, please follow the instructions.

## Instructions

Make sure you can run python files.

Download the files from this repository.

Run main.py.

Voil√†! You can now play my game :)

## Controls

If you're in water:
- a, s, w, d

If you're in air:
- a, d, Space

Always:
- p to pause and unpause
- Ctrl + s to save your game (input in console)
- Ctrl + l to load one of your saved games (you can also load fresh_install to start anew)
- Ctrl + d to delete one of your saved games (pls don't delete game files)
- Alt + Enter to enter fullscreen mode (performance issues)

I apologise for the lack of a playable demonstration, but I spent hours trying to get it to work, and it doesn't, so a video will have to do.
